## Structure

This tutorial has been designed in a modular way. Episodes can be thought as categorised as follows:
* Getting started (Core): eps. 1-3
* Customising containers: eps. 4-6
* Best practices and making using containers easier: eps. 7-8
* MPI containers and scaling to HPC: eps. 9
* Python containers : eps. 10
* (Bonus) Other tools : eps. 11

Once you've gone through Episodes 1-7, there are almost no further dependencies.
You can go on and pick whichever you are interested in, and you will be able to follow through.
