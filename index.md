## Structure

This tutorial has been designed in a modular way. Episodes can be thought as categorised as follows:
* Getting Started (Core): eps. 1-?
* Customising Containers: eps. ?-?
* Scaling to HPC: eps. ?-?

Once you've gone through Episodes ?-?, there are almost no further dependencies.  You can go on and pick whichever you are interested in, and you will be able to follow through.
