## Structure

This tutorial has been designed in a modular way. Episodes can be thought as categorised as follows:
* Getting Started (Core): eps. 1-3
* Customising Containers: eps. 4-6
* MPI containers and scaling to HPC: eps. 7-8

Once you've gone through Episodes 1-6, there are almost no further dependencies. You can go on and pick whichever you are interested in, and you will be able to follow through.
